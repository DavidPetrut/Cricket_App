This is a A.P.I MERN stack web application that has a user interface where you can add/update/delete/retrieve a player from a database. 
For user Interface or client I used REACT, Bootstrap, CSS. For the server(backend) I used JS, NodeJS, Express, Postman.

To use this app open the terminal and write:
1. npm run dev   (will open both back and front) on port 3000
3. alternatively you can run the backend on port 5000, and frontend on port 3000
2. if not working check if node modules installed and check if you have the last version of node 
3. if still not working, run:
npm i       command on cricket main folder and also in client folder as well, then try again :  npm run dev
THANK YOU!!!!
