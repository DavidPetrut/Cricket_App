To use this app open the terminal and write:
1. npm run dev   (will open both back and front) on port 3000
2. if not working check if node modules installed and check if you have the last version of node (when we did this project with the group we find we did not have it because its keep updating, just a tip)
3. if still not working, run:
npm i       command on cricket main folder and also in client folder as well, then try again :  npm run dev
THANK YOU!!!!
